# okta_jwt_validation


Workflow:
 - User using an App authenticates through front end using his own Okta credentials.
 - User calls App API sending id token
 - App uses gem to validate id token

**If the wrapper is needed**
 - App uses gem to get session token
 - App calls Wm-mssql-wrapper  passing session token
 - Wm-mssql-wrapper uses gem to validate session token.

The only App knowledge about Okta is the Figaro parameters.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'okta_jwt_validation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install okta_jwt_validation

## Usage

How to use:

```ruby
      token = OktaJwtValidation::AuthenticateApiRequest.new(
        request: request,
        okta_org: Figaro.env.OKTA_ORG,
        okta_domain: Figaro.env.OKTA_DOMAIN,
        okta_client_id: Figaro.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
      ).call
```

Where request is Rails ActionDispatch::Request to request a token.
